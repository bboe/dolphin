Dolphin is a webservice designed to promote discussion about better security
practices. At its core Dolphin provides a fun game-like environment that
encourages people to lock their computers complete with lists of "Recent
Dolphins", "Top Dolphinees", and "Top Dolphineers".

Dolphin relies on Google OAuth to verify accounts. Under non-public
deployments, it is intended to be configured to only authorize accounts from
the specific Google Apps domain.

A public demo version of Dolphin can be found at:
